		<h3>Half-Life 1 (1999)</h3>
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DwGcKFMxrmI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
		<p>In Half-Life, players assume the role of the protagonist, Dr. Gordon Freeman, a recent MIT graduate in theoretical physics, and also a recent employee at Black Mesa. After an experiment that goes horribly awry when an unexpected Resonance Cascade (an apparently completely fictitious occurrence) rips dimensional seams that devastate the facility, Gordon must fight to escape the now alien-infested facility as creatures from another world — known as Xen — subsequently enter through these dimensional seams.</p>

		<p> The game is set during May 200- in a remote area of New Mexico, USA at the Black Mesa Research Facility; a fictional complex that bears many similarities to both the Los Alamos National Laboratory and Area 51. As Freeman tries to make his way out of the ruined facility to find help for the injured, he soon discovers he is caught between two sides: the hostile aliens, and the Hazardous Environment Combat Unit, a military force dispatched to cover up the incident — including eliminating Freeman and the rest of the Black Mesa Science Team.</p> <p>Throughout the game, a mysterious figure known as the G-Man regularly appears, apparently monitoring Freeman's progress. Ultimately, Gordon uses the cooperation of surviving scientists and security officers to work his way to the mysterious Lambda Complex, where a team of scientists teleport him to the alien world Xen, where he must destroy the Nihilanth, the creature keeping Xen's side of the dimensional rift open.</p> <p> Half-Life's plot was originally inspired by the computer games Doom and Quake (both produced by id Software), Stephen King's novella The Mist, and an episode of The Outer Limits called "The Borderland". Valve’s in-house writer and author, Marc Laidlaw, who wrote the books Dad's Nuke and The 37th Mandala, later developed and expanded the plot.</p><p> However, the most distinctive aspect of the game is not the plot itself, but rather the way it is presented to the player. The game tells the story by flowing into scripted sequences that are integrated as part of the game rather than as cutscene intermissions. These sequences range from the introduction of major plot points such as the Resonance Cascade to bringing the player into a particularly difficult part of a level. Two of the intended results of this style of presentation were to increase immersion and to maintain a contiguous narrative that keeps the player's interest throughout. This differed from games at the time, making Half-Life distinct, as well as defining conventions that would last for years to come.</p><p> Valve implemented other factors to heighten the feeling of immersion, such as preventing the player from seeing or hearing their own character, who remains a silent protagonist throughout the game, and ensuring that the player rarely loses the ability to control Gordon, even during monologues. This constant experience of the game allowed players to totally fulfill and customize, almost, the role of Gordon, whilst letting them know who they were playing as. The scripted sequences maintain flow by keeping the player immersed in the game, whereas cutscenes in other contemporary games had often been a diversion from previous segments of gameplay. The levels for Half-Life were also divided into small sections to minimize long interruptions from loading.</p>

		<h3>Half-Life 2 (2004)</h3>

		<p>Dr. Freeman is taken out of stasis by his "employer" to help rid the planet of invading aliens forces known as the Combine that entered through the portals he helped create.</p><p> After previously causing portals to open between worlds, Gordon released a race of aliens from enslavement on Xen and was placed into stasis by a mysterious figure known only as the G-Man. Meanwhile a race of aliens known as the combine enslaved Earth and is devouring its resources. Freeman awakens on a train heading for a massive city known only as City 17. The alien Combine empire watches over its human minions from a massive fortress called the Citadel, within which the human governor is none other than Gordon Freeman's old administrator, Dr. Wallace Breen.</p><p> Uniting with the resistance fighters which contain some of his old acquaintances from the Black Mesa research facility (such as Barney Calhoun from Half-Life: Blue Shift), Gordon leads the resistance to free mankind with the help of the creatures he liberated from Xen, and the Antlion controlled with pheromones. After the fall of the first fortress G-Man places Gordon back into stasis. Years after the Black Mesa Incident (from the original Half Life game), the mysterious G-Man summons Gordon Freeman from his induced slumber.</p><p> Placing him on a train, Gordon finds himself in "City 17", one of an unknown number of 'urban centers,' where humans are kept in an Orwellian pseudo-slavery by a mysterious alien race known as the Combine. City 17, possibly located in eastern Europe, is overseen by Dr. Breen, a former administrator of Black Mesa who, after arranging the surrender of Earth to the Combine, was rewarded with a leadership position. Humans are now half-way oppressed by themselves. Prisons, concentration camps and urban centers alike are controlled by the Combine Overwatch, members of a somewhat voluntary military in which participation is rewarded with various benefits such as with better living conditions. People are also attracted to it because they would like to feel like being part of something greater then themselves, and also because they can get away with physically abusing, tormenting, and killing the civilians.</p> <p> A resistance stirs in the shadows... a large system of underground railroads are in place. The populace is on the edge of total rebellion. What they need is a little inspiration, and a little push, and Gordon Freeman may be just the man to provide it...</p>

		<h3>Half Life 2: Episode One (2006)</h3>
		<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HVy5Ajb34bI" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

		<p>In City 17, Gordon Freeman and his ally Alyx Vance have destroyed the reactor at the heart of the Combine Citadel. As it explodes, the G-Man intervenes and extracts Gordon. Several Vortigaunts appear and rescue Alyx from the blast. The Vortigaunts appear before the G-Man and stand between him and Gordon. They teleport Gordon away from the scene.</p>

		<p>Alyx's pet robot Dog retrieves Gordon from rubble outside the Citadel, and Gordon reunites with Alyx. Alyx contacts her father Eli Vance and scientist Isaac Kleiner, who have escaped the city. Kleiner tells them the Citadel's core will soon explode, which will destroy City 17. Alyx and Gordon re-enter the Citadel and stabilize the core.</p>
		<p>
		Alyx discovers the Combine are accelerating the destruction of the Citadel to send a "transmission packet" to the Combine's homeworld. She downloads a copy of the message, along a transmission from Dr. Judith Mossman, in which she mentions a "project" she has located, before she is cut off by a Combine attack.</p>

		<p>Alyx and Gordon board a train to escape the Citadel, but it derails. They proceed on foot in the city streets, fighting through the disorganized Combine forces and rampant alien infestations. They meet Barney Calhoun and a group of other survivors who are preparing to move to a train station to escape City 17. Alyx and Gordon provide cover for the passengers as they board.</p>

		<p>Alyx and Gordon take a different train out of City 17, escaping just as the reactor detonates and the Combine's message is transmitted. Several pods containing Combine Advisors launch from the Citadel as it detonates. The resulting shockwave derails the train.</p>
